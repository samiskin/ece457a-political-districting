\section{Introduction}
% The Summary should be a brief version of the full report. It should give the
% reader an accurate overview. Be brief, but be specific. 
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
I wish you the best of success.


\section{Literature Review}
% Conduct a critical survey on similar solutions and explain how your solution
% extends or differs from these solutions. 

\section{Problem Formulation and Modeling}
% Include the problem statement and describe its model.

\section{Proposed Solution}
% Generate an initial solution.
% Suggest a cost function (objective function) suitable for this problem.
% Define a suitable neighborhood operator.
% Define a suitable solving strategy for this problem.
% Select your own values for the parameter and explain the basis for your selection.
% Describe how each algorithm (TS, SA, GA, PSO and ACO) will proceed to solve this problem by performing at least two hand iterations on a reduced version of the problem.
% Implement the proposed solution using Matlab/Octave/Python.



\section{Performance Evaluation}
% Establish a set of evaluation metrics and run some experiments with different
% values of algorithm parameters to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the
% performance of the developed solution using different meta-heuristic
% optimization techniques. Students must identify the pros and cons of each
% technique and assess the quality of work as well as its fit with project
% objectives.

\section{Conclusions \& Recommendations}
% Summarize the conclusion and future improvement. Explain how did you solve the
% problem, what problems were met? what did the results show? And how to refine
% the proposed solution? You may organize ideas using lists or numbered points,
% if appropriate, but avoid making your report into a check-list or a series of
% encrypted notes 



\begin{thebibliography}{1}
% Every report needs references; in fact, your failure to consult
% references for guidance may be considered negligence. On the other
% hand, when you include sentences, photos, drawings or figures from
% other sources in your report, the complete reference must be cited.
% Failure to do so is plagiarism, an academic infraction with serious
% consequences.
